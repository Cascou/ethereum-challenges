# Ethereum Challenges

## ðŸ§  Overview
This repository contains my solutions and explorations of various Ethereum security and smart contract challenges. These challenges are designed to sharpen your understanding of the EVM, Solidity, and common vulnerabilities in decentralized applications.

## ðŸ§© Challenge Platforms

### [Capture the Ether](https://github.com/nicobevilacqua/CaptureTheEtherHardhat)
A series of smart contract puzzles that teach you about Solidity security. This version uses Hardhat for a modern development environment.

### [EVM Puzzles](https://github.com/fvictorio/evm-puzzles)
A collection of puzzles that test our understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and low-level Solidity behaviours (Opcodes/YUL).

### [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://github.com/theredguild/damn-vulnerable-defi)
A set of DeFi-focused challenges that replicate real-world vulnerabilities and attack vectors in decentralized financial protocols.

### [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com)
An interactive Web3-based game by OpenZeppelin that helps you learn Ethereum smart contract security through progressively harder hacking challenges.
